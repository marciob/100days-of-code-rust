# 100 Days of Code in Rust

I am taking the 100 Days of Code challenge in Rust. This means that for the next 100 days, I will be coding for at least one hour every day and sharing my progress here.

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that was first released in 2010. It is designed for performance, safety, and concurrency, and is often used for building high-performance applications such as web browsers, operating systems, and game engines.

## Basics.md

I am keeping track of my progress and learnings in the `basics.md` file. This file contains notes on the basics of Rust programming, such as syntax, data types, control flow, and functions.

## Conclusion

I'm excited to continue this challenge and see how my skills improve over the next 100 days. If you're interested in learning Rust or following my progress, feel free to check out my `basics.md` file or follow me on social media. Happy coding!
